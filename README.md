# Real-time Waste Detection System:An End-to-End YOLOv5 Solution
This is a real-time waste detection system, which uses YOLOv5 for object detection. It is a complete solution that includes training and deployment. The system is built using Python, PyTorch, and YOLOv5. It allows users to upload images or videos for waste detection, and the system will provide real-time results.

### Project Workflow:

1. **constant**: Define constants and configurations for the project.
2. **entity**: Define entities for the project.
3. **components**: Define components for the project.
4. **pipeline**: Define the pipeline for the project.
5. **aap.py**: Define the main function for the project.

### How to run the project:
**clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcm-ai/Real-time-Waste-Detection-System-An-End-to-End-YOLOv5-Solution.git
```
**Create a virtual environment or conda environment after cloning the repository**
```bash
conda create --name waste python=3.10 -y
```
*Incase if you get error (for example: CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate') when activate environment, use below command:*
```bash
source activate base
```
**Then, Activate an environment:**
```bash
conda activate waste
```
**Install the required packages Install the required packages using pip or conda. For example, to install the required packages using pip , run the following command:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
